# QOTD – Question of the Day (Frontend)

This project is a **frontend-only implementation** of a **Question of the Day (QOTD)** experience
for an edtech platform similar to **TechLearn Solutions**.

The goal of this page is to motivate students to solve **one DSA problem daily** while providing
a clean, engaging, and intuitive interface that supports focus, consistency, and progress tracking.

## 🚀 Tech Stack Used

- **React**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **TypeScript**
- **Vercel** (Deployment)

This stack was chosen to ensure modern frontend practices, scalability, and fast performance.

## 🎨 Layout & Design Decisions

- The **Question title, difficulty, and problem statement** are placed at the top to immediately
  orient the user.
- The **coding area and primary CTA (Run / Submit)** are visually dominant to encourage action.
- Secondary information such as **statistics, leaderboard, and hints** is placed below the main
  problem area to reduce cognitive load.
- A **monotone blue color palette** is used to maintain focus and convey trust and clarity.
- The layout follows a **mobile-first, responsive design** to support students practicing on any device.

## 📈 How This Page Encourages Daily Engagement

- The **“Question of the Day”** framing promotes habit formation.
- A **streak indicator** (mocked) motivates consistency.
- **Statistics cards** provide instant feedback on performance.
- A **leaderboard** introduces healthy competition.
- A **subscribe / notify CTA** encourages users to return daily for new challenges.

## 🧪 Data Handling

All data used in this project is **static / mock data**.
No backend services or APIs are implemented, as the focus is purely on frontend design and UX.

## 🔧 What I Would Improve With More Time

- Integrate a real code execution environment (sandbox)
- Add user authentication and persistent streak tracking
- Backend-powered leaderboard and analytics
